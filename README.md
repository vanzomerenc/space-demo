# space-demo

This is something I wrote in 2020 when I had some free time and was interested in orbital mechanics simulations.

It's a very simple demo of an integration method I found in "Higher Order Force Gradient Symplectic Algorithms",
by Chin and Kidwell (2000) https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0006082v1

This project is structured strangely because it includes a rudimentary live-coding environment.
`./run-proto orbit1` or `./run-proto orbit2` will run one of the demo projects, and will restart it
whenever any of the source files changes.
